"Distinct features in fish Bouncer proteins determine sperm-egg compatibility"

Abstract:

All sexually reproducing organisms depend on fertilization to produce offspring and survive as species. Despite the importance of fertilization, the mechanisms that drive sperm-egg compatibility and enable species-specific gamete interaction are poorly understood. In fish, a single egg protein, Bouncer, has been shown to be necessary for fertilization and is species-specific between medaka and zebrafish. Here, we investigate whether Bouncer is a general species-specific fertilization protein in fish and seek to identify the features mediating its specificity between medaka and zebrafish. Comparative in vitro fertilization experiments using zebrafish and medaka sperm with transgenic zebrafish eggs show that Bouncer is not a general specificity factor. Instead, its homologs exhibit wide compatibility with sperm, in line with the pervasive purifying selection that dominates Bouncer’s evolution in fish. We further uncover specific features of Bouncer—distinct amino acid residues and N-glycosylation patterns—that differentially influence the function of medaka and zebrafish Bouncer homologs and contribute to medaka/zebrafish specificity. This work reveals important themes central to understanding Bouncer’s function in sperm binding and clarifying the molecular requirements for Bouncer’s sperm interaction partner.
